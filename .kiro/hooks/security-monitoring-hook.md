# Security Monitoring Hook

## Trigger
**Event**: Continuous monitoring or security event detection
**Button Label**: "Monitor Security Status"

## Description
Continuously monitor system security, detect threats, manage user authentication, and maintain comprehensive audit trails for enterprise-grade security compliance.

## Execution Steps
1. Initialize advanced security monitoring systems
2. Monitor user authentication attempts and detect suspicious patterns
3. Track API access patterns and identify potential abuse
4. Scan for unusual trading patterns that might indicate account compromise
5. Monitor system access logs for unauthorized activities
6. Detect and block malicious IP addresses automatically
7. Validate session integrity and enforce timeout policies
8. Generate security alerts for high-risk events
9. Maintain encrypted audit logs for compliance reporting
10. Perform automated security health checks and vulnerability assessments

## Success Criteria
- All user sessions properly authenticated and monitored
- Suspicious activities detected and blocked in real-time
- Comprehensive audit logs maintained with proper encryption
- Security alerts generated for events exceeding risk thresholds
- Failed login attempts properly tracked and rate-limited
- System access patterns analyzed for anomaly detection

## Error Handling
- If security monitoring fails, activate emergency lockdown procedures
- If authentication system fails, implement backup verification methods
- If audit logging fails, store events in backup systems and alert administrators
- If threat detection fails, increase manual monitoring and send alerts
- If encryption systems fail, secure sensitive data and notify security team
- Provide immediate notifications for all critical security failures
